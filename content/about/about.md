### Goals 

My goal is to develop high-quality, impactful robotics solutions using years of expertise with industrial automation hardware and software systems to make a more sustainable and equitable world.

I am currently pursing my master’s in computer science at RIT while working for GIS. 

### Background

I Graduated Summa Cum Laude from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor’s of Science in Robotics & Manufacturing Engineering Technology.

I'm from New York and have lived in the state my whole life. 

My work with the Golisano Institute for Sustainability has enabled me to learn how to use automation technology to benefit the circular economy. At GIS, I grew a passion for programming robots to handle used parts for recycling and determine the best methods for reusing high energy cost products. 

In my first co-op with GIS in Rochester, I learned how to use the Robot Operating System framework and dug deep into FOSS linux computing to support projects that enable New York State companies to produce goods more sustainabily.

Working for GIS was so rewarding, I worked part time while finishing my degree.

My first co-op of my undergrad was with Alstom Transport in Hornell, New York, as a mechanical design intern. I gained an invaluable perspective on train design and how large, synchronous systems are built. I was able to leverage my mechanical design skills and improve mechanical systems, and have since used those skills to create hobbiest robotics projects.
