### Goals 

My goal is to develop high-quality, impactful robotics solutions using years of expertise with industrial automation hardware and software systems to make a more sustainable and equitable world.

I am currently pursing my master’s in computer science at RIT while working for GIS. 

### Background

I Graduated Summa Cum Laude from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor’s of Science in Robotics & Manufacturing Engineering Technology.

My work with the Golisano Institute for Sustainability has enabled my contributions to the application of automation technology in the circular economy. With GIS, I grew a passion for programming robots to handle used parts for recycling and determine the best methods for reusing high energy cost products. 

In my first co-op with GIS, I learned ROS and dug deep into FOSS linux computing to leverage the large software community in support of our projects.

My first co-op during my undergrad at Alstom Transport, I gained an invaluable perspective on train design and how large, synchronous systems are built. I was able to leverage my mechanical design skills and improve mechanical systems.
